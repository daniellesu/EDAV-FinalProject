# EDAV-FinalProject
A collaborative exploratory data analysis and visualization project that takes a look at Columbia data science students' music patterns in 2017.

Music patterns were identified within Spotify users' 'Your Top 2017' playlist created by Spotify for each of its users in 2017. Project makes extensive use of R's Spotify API (spotifyr).

For our interactive component, we decided to make a game where the users can gain insight into the audio features of a song as well as interesting trends of popular songs in DSI 2017 playlists. We used D3 to build this interactive component.
