In this final project, my group and I will be looking at Spotify data provided by the students in EDAV. We thought it would be interesting to look at the music tastes of our class. We will specifically be looking at the playlists automatically created by Spotify last year at the end of 2017 entitled 'Your Top Songs 2017'. This is a playlist that Spotify automatically created of the 100 most played songs for each of its users in the year 2017. This seems like it will be a pretty good indicator of people's personal music tastes...or at least a look into how their 2017 was. 

For this project, we will be using the Spotify API and the R package for it, Spotifyr. Note that we are using the dev version of this package, not the CRAN version. 

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(spotifyr)
# input your own spotify client id and spotify client secret to be able to use Spotify's API
Sys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = '')
Sys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = '')

access_token <- get_spotify_access_token()
```

For this assignment, I will be looking at the danceability of mine and my group's "Your Top Songs 2017". I am hoping that along the way I will gain interesting insights about how this track feature is related to other variables as well as how it is distributed across my group members. 

The very first step is to load the playlist from my Spotify account and get the audio features. That is what the following code chunk accomplishes. 

```{r}
setwd("~/Columbia/EDAV/FinalProject/EDAV-FinalProject")
library(tidyverse)
playlists <- get_user_playlists('leac750')
my_2017 <- playlists[which(playlists$playlist_name == 'Your Top Songs 2017'),]
lea <- get_playlist_audio_features('leac750', my_2017$playlist_uri)
```

Danceability is a continous variable between 0 and 1 so it seems reasonable to start with a histogram as a first visualization. Note that the below histogram will only show the danceability of songs within my playlist. I've played around a bit with the number of bins to be able to see the main patterns without getting too caught in capturing every minute detail.

```{r}
my_dance_hist <- ggplot(my_2017, aes(x = danceability)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "blue", fill = "#99CCFF", bins = 20) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(0), max(1.0), by = 0.1)) +
  ylab("Frequency")
my_dance_hist
```

There are definitely two modes here, one at ~0.65 danceability and one at ~0.75. What is clear is that there are a higher number of songs that have at least 0.5 danceability or higher in my playlist (I am not surprised by this). I will also look at a density curve of this variable for my playlist simply because it was a bit hard to choose the number of bins that was appropriate and the density curve allows us to circumvent this issue. I think I will also make density curve graphs for my group members' playlists as well to more easily compare the danceability between our playlists. 

```{r}
my_dance_density <- ggplot(my_2017, aes(x = danceability,  fill = "#99CCFF")) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(0), max(1), by = 0.1))
my_dance_density
```

Okay so that doesn't look great so I think I will just make a density curve graph to compare all of our playlists. The code below gets everyone else's playlists. 

```{r}
danielle <- get_playlist_audio_features('danielle219', '37i9dQZF1E9Lke9WJ01eT7')
hammaad <- get_playlist_audio_features('1256140081', '37i9dQZF1E9ECwVUJQFrgP')
kelly <- get_playlist_audio_features('22ugjl3xvvzgwtbwi3ubpt72a', '37i9dQZF1E9VRPVezelVUk')
```

```{r}
lea$user_id <- 'lea'
hammaad$user_id <- 'hammaad'
kelly$user_id <- 'kelly'
danielle$user_id <- 'danielle'
all <- rbind(my_2017, hammaad)
all <- rbind(all, kelly)
all <- rbind(all, danielle)
setwd("~/Columbia/EDAV/FinalProject/EDAV-FinalProject")
# writing group data to csv
write.csv(all, file = "GroupData.csv")
```

To compare everyone's distribution of danceability in their top 2017 songs, I will make a faceted histogram, a density curve and a boxplot graph. I'll decide later which one I think is best. 

```{r}
all$user_id <- as.factor(all$user_id)
all_danceability_density <- ggplot(all, aes(x = danceability, fill = user_id)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.3) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(0), max(1), by = 0.1))
all_danceability_density
```

Perhaps a ridgeline plot would actually be better here. 

```{r}
library(ggridges)
all_ridges <- ggplot(all, aes(x = danceability, y = user_id)) + 
  geom_density_ridges2(scale = 2, fill = "#99CCFF") +
  theme_ridges() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(0), max(1), by = 0.1)) +
  ylab("User")
all_ridges
```


```{r}
all_box <- ggplot(all, aes(x = reorder(user_id, danceability, FUN = median), y = danceability)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill='#99CCFF', color="black")
all_box
```

```{r}
all_hist <-ggplot(all, aes(x=danceability))+
  geom_histogram(color="blue", fill="#99CCFF", bins = 20)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(0), max(1), by = 0.1)) +
  facet_grid(user_id ~ .) 
all_hist
```

Quick instinct: boxplot is easiest to read in this case.

Now I want to look at the relation of danceability to other continuous variables in the dataset. Initial variables that seem interesting to look at in their relationship to danceability is: track_popularity, energy, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, liveness, valence, tempo and duration. I don't want to make a scatterplot matrix because I want to really focus on danceability so I'll use the ggarrange() function from the **ggpubr** package.

Before plotting, I'm just going to normalize every category that is not already between 0 and 1.

```{r}
x <- all$loudness
all$normalized_loudness <- (x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x))
all$normalized_pop <- all$track_popularity/100
x <- all$tempo
all$normalized_tempo <- (x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x))
x <- all$duration_ms
all$normalized_duration <- (x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x))
```

```{r}
dance_loudness <- ggplot(all, aes(x = normalized_loudness, y = danceability)) + geom_point() + theme_classic()
dance_pop <- ggplot(all, aes(x = normalized_pop, y = danceability)) + geom_point() + theme_classic()
dance_speech <- ggplot(all, aes(x = speechiness, y = danceability)) + geom_point() + theme_classic()
dance_valence <- ggplot(all, aes(x = valence, y = danceability)) + geom_point() + theme_classic()
dance_acoustic <- ggplot(all, aes(x = acousticness, y = danceability)) + geom_point() + theme_classic()
dance_live <- ggplot(all, aes(x = liveness, y = danceability)) + geom_point() + theme_classic()
dance_tempo <- ggplot(all, aes(x = normalized_tempo, y = danceability)) + geom_point() + theme_classic()
dance_energy <- ggplot(all, aes(x = energy, y = danceability)) + geom_point() + theme_classic()
dance_duration <- ggplot(all, aes(x = normalized_duration, y = danceability)) + geom_point() + theme_classic()
```

```{r, fig.height = 12, fig.width = 20}
library(ggpubr)
ggarrange(dance_valence, dance_loudness, dance_pop, dance_acoustic, dance_energy, dance_tempo, dance_live, dance_speech, dance_duration + rremove("x.text"),
          ncol = 3, nrow = 3)
```

It seems that there is no strong correlation between danceability and any of the variables explored. There is a slight positive correlation between danceability and valence. For fun, let's look at a scatterplot of valence for each person in my group. NOTE: after doing a small amount of research, it seems that liveness is an estimate of the probability that the track was recorded live, so it makes sense why this would have nothing to do with danceability. 

```{r}
lea_valence <- ggplot(my_2017, aes(x = valence, y = danceability)) + geom_point() + theme_classic()
kelly_valence <- ggplot(kelly, aes(x = valence, y = danceability)) + geom_point() + theme_classic()
hammaad_valence <- ggplot(hammaad, aes(x = valence, y = danceability)) + geom_point() + theme_classic()
danielle_valence <- ggplot(danielle, aes(x = valence, y = danceability)) + geom_point() + theme_classic()
ggarrange(lea_valence, kelly_valence, danielle_valence, hammaad_valence + rremove("x.text"),
             labels = c("Lea", "Kelly", "Danielle", "Hammaad"),
          ncol = 2, nrow = 2)
```

They actually all look fairly positively correlated so let's just look at the correlation coefficients between valence and danceability for each person. 

```{r}
cor(my_2017$valence, my_2017$danceability)
cor(kelly$valence, kelly$danceability)
cor(danielle$valence, danielle$danceability)
cor(hammaad$valence, hammaad$danceability)
```

Kelly and my song's have decent correlation between danceability and valence whereas Hammaad and Danielle's songs really don't have much. Interesting to note!

### Cleaning the class data

Now that we've sent out our survey and have given our classmates some time to answer, it's time to analyze it! The first step is to clean up the survey data. The most important part of this is being able to extract the Spotify user's id and their playlist id. Other cleaning that will be necessary is things like location, but these are not a main priority. 

```{r}
# reading in and changing the column names
survey_data <- read_csv("StudentResponses.csv", col_names = TRUE)
names(survey_data) <- c("Timestamp", "email", "uni", "age", "gender", "nationality", "location2017", "undergrad", "useFrequency", "username", "playlistID", "otherPlatform", "consent")
```

```{r}
library(stringr)
pattern <- '^spotify:user:(\\S*)$|^https://open\\.spotify\\.com/user/([^?]*)'
matches <- str_match(survey_data$username, pattern)
match1 <- matches[,2]
match2 <- matches[,3]

user <- c()

for (i in seq_along(match1)){
 if(!is.na(match1[i])){
   user <- c(user, match1[i])
 }
 else if(!is.na(match2[i])){
   user <- c(user, match2[i])
 }
 else{
   user <- c(user, NA)
 }
}

survey_data$cleanUser <- user

pattern2 <- '^spotify:user:[\\S]*:playlist:(\\S*)$|^https:\\/\\/open\\.spotify\\.com\\/playlist\\/(\\S*)$|^https:\\/\\/open\\.spotify\\.com\\/user\\/spotify\\/playlist\\/(\\S*)[\\?].*$'
playlist_matches <- str_match(survey_data$playlistID, pattern2)
playlist_matches1 <- playlist_matches[,2]
playlist_matches2 <- playlist_matches[,3]
playlist_matches3 <- playlist_matches[,4]

playlist_id <- c()

for (i in seq_along(playlist_matches1)){
 if(!is.na(playlist_matches1[i])){
   playlist_id <- c(playlist_id, playlist_matches1[i])
 }
 else if(!is.na(playlist_matches2[i])){
   playlist_id <- c(playlist_id, playlist_matches2[i])
 }
 else if(!is.na(playlist_matches3[i])){
   playlist_id <- c(playlist_id, playlist_matches3[i])
 }
 else{
   playlist_id <- c(playlist_id, NA)
 }
}

survey_data$cleanPlaylist <- playlist_id
```

Now that I've extracted everyone's user ID and their playlist ID, I'm going to clean up some of the other information, such as city and university.

```{r}
# cleaning up city
for (i in seq_along(survey_data$location2017)){
  if(!is.na(survey_data$location2017[i])){
    if(survey_data$location2017[i] == 'bangalore, India'){
    survey_data$location2017[i] = 'Bangalore, India'
  }
  if(survey_data$location2017[i] == 'NYC' || survey_data$location2017[i] == 'NYC, USA'){
    survey_data$location2017[i] = 'New York, USA'
  }
  if(survey_data$location2017[i] == 'Boston' || survey_data$location2017[i] == 'Boston,USA'){
    survey_data$location2017[i] = 'Boston, USA'
  }
  }
}
```

```{r}
# cleaning up undergrad
for (i in seq_along(survey_data$undergrad)){
  if(!is.na(survey_data$undergrad[i])){
    if(survey_data$undergrad[i] == 'Itam' || survey_data$undergrad[i] == 'Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico'){
    survey_data$undergrad[i] = 'ITAM'
  }
  if(survey_data$undergrad[i] == 'Cornell'){
    survey_data$undergrad[i] = 'Cornell University'
  }
  if(survey_data$undergrad[i] == 'Vellore institute of technology' || survey_data$undergrad[i] == 'Vellore Institute of Technology, India'){
    survey_data$undergrad[i] = 'Vellore Institute of Technology'
  }
  }
}
```

```{r}
class_playlists = data.frame()

for (i in seq_along(survey_data$cleanUser)){
  if(!is.na(survey_data$cleanUser[i]) && !is.na(survey_data$cleanPlaylist)){
    # print(survey_data$cleanUser[i])
    temp <- get_playlist_audio_features(survey_data$cleanUser[i], survey_data$cleanPlaylist[i])
    temp$user_id <- survey_data$cleanUser[i]
    temp$location2017 <- survey_data$location2017[i]
    temp$nationality <- survey_data$nationality[i]
    temp$undergrad <- survey_data$undergrad[i]
    temp$age <- survey_data$age[i]
    temp$useFrequency <- survey_data$useFrequency[i]
    class_playlists <- rbind(class_playlists, temp)
  }
}

lea$undergrad <- 'McGill University'
hammaad$undergrad <- 'Yale University'
kelly$undergrad <- 'University of Rochester'
danielle$undergrad <- 'Duke University'

lea$location2017 <- 'Montreal, CA'
hammaad$location2017 <- 'Boston, USA'
kelly$location2017 <- 'New York, USA'
danielle$location2017 <- 'New York, USA'

lea$nationality <- 'France'
hammaad$nationality <- 'India'
kelly$nationality <- 'China'
danielle$nationality <- 'United States'

lea$age <- 22
hammaad$age <- 24
kelly$age <- 24
danielle$age <- 24

lea$useFrequency <- 3
hammaad$useFrequency <- 5
kelly$useFrequency <- 3
danielle$useFrequency <- 5

class_playlists <- rbind(class_playlists, lea)
class_playlists <- rbind(class_playlists, hammaad)
class_playlists <- rbind(class_playlists, kelly)
class_playlists <- rbind(class_playlists, danielle)

# writing all music data to csv
write.csv(class_playlists, file = "ClassMusicData.csv")
```

The data were all cleaned on Monday, 11/26
Now that the data is cleaned up, I can perform a more extensive data analysis. I will probably start by looking at the danceability patterns for the whole data, as I did for the 4th assignment. I am then curious to find out what features the most popular artists have in common (if any). I am hoping to answer that question through visualizations.

### New workflow starts here

```{r}
setwd("~/Columbia/EDAV/FinalProject/EDAV-FinalProject")
library(tidyverse)
# this file include track genre and the student's name
lea_class_data <- read_csv("Final_DSI_Playlist.csv", col_names = TRUE)

lea_class_data$rank <- NULL
lea_class_data$album_label <- NULL
lea_class_data$album_name1 <- NULL
lea_class_data$album_id <- NULL
lea_class_data$album_data <- NULL
lea_class_data$album_name2 <- NULL
lea_class_data$album_id1 <- NULL
lea_class_data$album_label1 <- NULL
lea_class_data$album_date <- NULL
lea_class_data$album_date1 <- NULL
```

#### Exploring Danceability

```{r}
dance_hist <- ggplot(class_data, aes(x = danceability)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "blue", fill = "#99CCFF", bins = 28) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(0), max(1.0), by = 0.1)) +
  ylab("Frequency")
dance_hist
```

The danceability histogram shows that the data is slightly left-skewed with only one mode around 0.65, so EDAV students enjoy some slightly 'dancier' music. Now let's make a ridgeplot just for fun to see how different people's danceability tastes are. To make it actually interesting to compare everyone's danceability, it would be nice to have everyone's names displayed (with their consent). The following code adds the person's name to the dataset.

```{r}
# cleaning up the data a bit

x <- lea_class_data$loudness
lea_class_data$normalized_loudness <- (x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x))
lea_class_data$normalized_pop <- lea_class_data$track_popularity/100
lea_class_data$normalized_artist_pop <- lea_class_data$artist_popularity/100
x <- lea_class_data$tempo
lea_class_data$normalized_tempo <- (x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x))
x <- lea_class_data$instrumentalness 
lea_class_data$normalized_instrumentalness <- (x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x))

display_class_data <- lea_class_data[which(lea_class_data$`Display` == 'Yes'),]

# selecting only the continuous variables from the dataset
cont_var <- lea_class_data %>% select(normalized_pop, danceability, energy, normalized_loudness, speechiness, acousticness, normalized_instrumentalness, valence, normalized_tempo)

names(cont_var) <- c("popularity", "dance", "energy", "loud", "speech", "acoustic", "instrumental", "valence", "tempo")
```

To explore both how similar DSI students are in their music preferences and the key ways in which they differ, we thought it would first be interesting to see which students like songs and artists that have been deemed 'popular' by Spotify. 


```{r}
avg_class_data <- display_class_data %>% group_by(Name) %>% summarise_at(vars(normalized_artist_pop, normalized_pop, danceability, energy, valence, normalized_loudness, speechiness, acousticness, normalized_instrumentalness, normalized_tempo), funs(mean(., na.rm = TRUE)))

names(avg_class_data) <- c("Name", "Artist Popularity", "Track Popularity", "Danceability", "Energy", "Valence", "Loudness"," Speechiness", "Acousticness", "Instrumentalness", "Tempo")

tidy_avg <- avg_class_data %>% select(Name, `Track Popularity`, `Artist Popularity`) %>% 
  arrange(`Track Popularity`) %>% 
  mutate(Name = factor(Name, levels = .$Name)) %>% tidyr::gather(key = 'Category', value = 'Percentage', -Name)

pop_cd <- ggplot(tidy_avg, aes(x = Percentage, y = Name, color = Category)) +
          geom_point() + ylab("") + theme_minimal() +
          ggtitle("Hammaad and Lea Are Basic AF") +
        scale_color_manual(values=c("red", "blue")) +
    theme(legend.title=element_text(size=15), legend.text=element_text(size=13))
pop_cd
```

Let's see who listens to the happiest music. And let's see if that has any relation to danceability since we see below that there's some correlation between the two. 

```{r}
tidy_avg <- avg_class_data %>% select(Name, Valence, Danceability) %>% 
  arrange(Valence) %>% 
  mutate(Name = factor(Name, levels = .$Name)) %>% tidyr::gather(key = 'Category', value = 'Percentage', -Name)

pop_cd <- ggplot(tidy_avg, aes(x = Percentage, y = Name, color = Category)) +
          geom_point() + ylab("") + theme_minimal() +
        scale_color_manual(values=c("red", "blue")) +
    theme(legend.title=element_text(size=15), legend.text=element_text(size=13))
pop_cd
```

```{r}
library(ggridges)
all_ridges <- ggplot(display_class_data, aes(x = danceability, y = reorder(Name, danceability, FUN = median))) + 
  geom_density_ridges2(scale = 2, fill = "#99CCFF") +
  theme_ridges() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(0), max(1), by = 0.1)) +
  ylab("User")
all_ridges
```

Now that we have more songs to look at, let's look at the correlation between all of the continuous variables by making a scatterplot matrix. 

```{r}
library(GGally)
scatter_vars <- ggpairs(cont_var, title = "", axisLabels = "show", progress = FALSE)
scatter_vars
```

Many of the variables are uncorrelated or very weakly correlated. The strongest positive correlations are between energy and loudness (0.786), valence and energy (0.4), valence and danceability (0.395), and loudness and valence (0.323). It's interesting that track popularity is not really correlated with any of the variables (what other things could we look at that might be indicators of whether a track will be popular/how does Spotify calculate track popularity). What's interesting is that Spotify claims that it calculates danceability based on the tempo but not only is there almost no correlation between danceability and tempo, but there are even slightly negatively correlated! What's up with that?

Now that we've looked a bit at how features relate to each other, I want to know a bit more about the most popular artists (popular amongst EDAV students), and see if these artists have any track features in common compared to other artists. I'll probably take a look at the top 10 artists and compare these features to the rest of the artists. We can similarly do something for the top 10 songs (and I probably will do so). NOTE: should get the most popular artist by grouping by the user id and then counting how many times the artist shows up. 

```{r}
top_ten_artists <- as.data.frame(rev(sort(table(lea_class_data$artist_name)))[1:10])
top_ten_songs <- as.data.frame(rev(sort(table(lea_class_data$track_name)))[1:50])
top_ten_artists$Var1 <- as.factor(top_ten_artists$Var1)
top_ten_songs$Var1 <- as.factor(top_ten_songs$Var1)
```

Just to visualize these counts, we will make 'histograms' (bar charts) for this data.

```{r}
artist_chart <- ggplot(top_ten_artists, aes(reorder(Var1, -Freq), Freq)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', color="#3333FF", fill="#99CCFF", width = 0.90) + 
  xlab("Artist") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  ggtitle("Top Ten Artists")
artist_chart
```

```{r}
song_chart <- ggplot(top_ten_songs[1:10,], aes(reorder(Var1, -Freq), Freq)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', color="#3333FF", fill="#99CCFF", width = 0.90) + 
  xlab("Song Name") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  ggtitle("EDAV Stays HUMBLE.")
song_chart
```

I think what will be easiest to be able to observe the differences between artists that are amongst the most popular and others is to make a new column that is just true or false based on if the artist is in the top 10 or not. I'll do the same thing for the top songs as well. 

```{r}
lea_class_data$`Artist Popularity` <- ifelse(lea_class_data$artist_name %in% top_ten_artists$Var1, "EDAV Top 10", "EDAV Not Top 10")
lea_class_data$`Song Popularity` <- ifelse(lea_class_data$track_name %in% top_ten_songs$Var1, "EDAV Top 50", "EDAV Not Top 50")

edav_top_50_songs <- lea_class_data[which(lea_class_data$`Song Popularity` == 'EDAV Top 50'), ]
edav_not_top_50_songs <- lea_class_data[which(lea_class_data$`Song Popularity` == 'EDAV Not Top 50'), ]
edav_top_10_artists <- lea_class_data[which(lea_class_data$`Artist Popularity` == 'EDAV Top 10'), ]
edav_not_top_10_artists <- lea_class_data[which(lea_class_data$`Artist Popularity` == 'EDAV Not Top 10'), ]

edav_top_50_songs$playlist_name <- 'EDAV Top 50 Songs'
edav_not_top_50_songs$playlist_name <- 'EDAV Not Top 50 Songs'
edav_top_10_artists$playlist_name <- 'EDAV Top 10 Artists'
edav_not_top_10_artists$playlist_name <- 'EDAV Not Top 10 Artists'
```

To compare EDAV's tastes in 2017 to what's generally popular today, and was very popular in 2017, we will compare some features to Spotify's 'US Top 50', 'Global Top 50' and 'Top Tracks 2017' playlists.

```{r}
us_top_50 <- get_playlist_audio_features('spotifycharts', '37i9dQZEVXbLRQDuF5jeBp')
global_top_50 <- get_playlist_audio_features('spotifycharts','37i9dQZEVXbMDoHDwVN2tF')
top_2017 <- get_playlist_audio_features('spotify', '37i9dQZF1DX5nwnRMcdReF')
```

```{r}
# normalizing all variables to be between 0 and 1
x <- us_top_50$loudness
us_top_50$normalized_loudness <- (x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x))
us_top_50$normalized_pop <- us_top_50$track_popularity/100
x <- us_top_50$tempo
us_top_50$normalized_tempo <- (x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x))
x <- us_top_50$instrumentalness 
us_top_50$normalized_instrumentalness <- (x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x))

x <- global_top_50$loudness
global_top_50$normalized_loudness <- (x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x))
global_top_50$normalized_pop <- global_top_50$track_popularity/100
x <- global_top_50$tempo
global_top_50$normalized_tempo <- (x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x))
x <- global_top_50$instrumentalness 
global_top_50$normalized_instrumentalness <- (x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x))

x <- top_2017$loudness
top_2017$normalized_loudness <- (x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x))
top_2017$normalized_pop <- top_2017$track_popularity/100
x <- top_2017$tempo
top_2017$normalized_tempo <- (x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x))
x <- top_2017$instrumentalness 
top_2017$normalized_instrumentalness <- (x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x))

We now need to combine all the data together. I'm just going to put it all in a new data frame since the top 50 charts won't have all the same columns and I want to keep the class data all together and consistent. For now, I'll only be comparing features between the top 50 songs from EDAV and the Spotify playlists (ie. ignoring the less popular EDAV songs)

```{r}
excluded_vars <- c('gender', 'user_id', 'location2017', 'nationality', 'undergrad', 'age', 'useFrequency', 'Name', 'Display', 'artist_uri', 'artist_genres', 'Name', 'Artist Popularity', 'Song Popularity', 'artist_popularity', 'artist_num_followers', 'normalized_artist_pop')
edav_top_50_songs <- select(edav_top_50_songs, -excluded_vars)
edav_not_top_50_songs <- select(edav_not_top_50_songs, -excluded_vars)
edav_top_10_artists <- select(edav_top_10_artists, -excluded_vars)
edav_not_top_10_artists <- select(edav_not_top_10_artists, -excluded_vars)

all_data <- rbind(edav_top_50_songs, us_top_50)
all_data <- rbind(all_data, global_top_50)
all_data <- rbind(all_data, top_2017)
```

```{r}
diff_pop_songs <- ggplot(all_data, aes(x = track_popularity, fill = playlist_name)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) + xlab("Track Popularity")
diff_pop_songs
```

```{r}
diff_energy_songs <- ggplot(all_data, aes(x = energy, fill = playlist_name)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) + xlab("Energy")
diff_energy_songs
```

```{r}
diff_dance_songs <- ggplot(all_data, aes(x = danceability, fill = playlist_name)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) + xlab("Danceability")
diff_dance_songs
```

```{r}
diff_loud_songs <- ggplot(all_data, aes(x = normalized_loudness, fill = playlist_name)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) + xlab("Loudness")
diff_loud_songs
```

```{r}
diff_speech_songs <- ggplot(all_data, aes(x = speechiness, fill = playlist_name)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) + xlab("Speechiness")
diff_speech_songs
```

```{r}
diff_valence_songs <- ggplot(all_data, aes(x = valence, fill = playlist_name)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) + xlab("Valence")
diff_valence_songs
```

```{r}
diff_acoustic_songs <- ggplot(all_data, aes(x = acousticness, fill = playlist_name)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) + xlab("Acousticness")
diff_acoustic_songs
```

```{r}
diff_tempo_songs <- ggplot(all_data, aes(x = normalized_tempo, fill = playlist_name)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) + xlab("Tempo")
diff_tempo_songs
```

```{r}
# I don't think I like this plot
pop_ridges <- ggplot(all_data, aes(x = danceability, y = playlist_name)) + 
  geom_density_ridges2(scale = 2, fill = "#99CCFF") +
  theme_ridges() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(0), max(1), by = 0.1)) 
pop_ridges
```

Consider looking at more than the top 10 songs from the EDAV playlists, consider 50 to compare better to the Spotify playlists we're comparing to.

Let's compare now just the popular songs and less popular songs within EDAV to compare their features. It seems that EDAV follows the general Spotify trends in terms of 'most popular' tastes. There's still a lot of songs to look at though and to compare.

We'll look at all the continous variables again, but let's start with loudness since that was the one feature that was quite higher in EDAV's Top 50 compared to the songs in the Spotify-made playlists.

```{r}
edav_acoustic_songs <- ggplot(class_data, aes(x = normalized_loudness, fill = `Song Popularity`)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) + xlab("Loudness")
edav_acoustic_songs
```

Let's look at this as a boxplot just for fun. 
```{r}
all_data$`Song Popularity` <- as.factor(all_data$`Song Popularity`)
loud_box <- ggplot(all_data, aes(x=`Song Popularity`, y=normalized_loudness)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = median(all_data$normalized_loudness), color = "black", alpha = 0.4) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  xlab("Playlist") + ylab("Loudness")
loud_box
```

```{r}
all_data <- rbind(all_data, edav_not_top_50_songs)
```

When showing all 5 'playlists', it's actually nicer as a boxplot as it's quite a bit easier to read. 

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8}
edav_loud_box <- ggplot(all_data, aes(x=reorder(playlist_name, -1*normalized_loudness, FUN=median), y=normalized_loudness)) + 
  geom_boxplot(fill='#CCCCFF') + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  ggtitle("EDAV, Keep It Down") +
  xlab("Playlist") + ylab("Loudness") + 
  theme_minimal(16) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
edav_loud_box
```

```{r}
edav_tempo_box <- ggplot(all_data, aes(x = reorder(playlist_name, -1*normalized_tempo, FUN = median), y = normalized_tempo)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill='#FF9966') + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = median(all_data$normalized_tempo), color = "black", alpha = 0.4) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  xlab("Playlist") + ylab("Tempo")
edav_tempo_box
```

Drives the point home about tempo less than the density curve, above. 

```{r}
edav_valence_box <- ggplot(all_data, aes(x = reorder(playlist_name, -1*valence, FUN = median), y = valence)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill='#FF9966') + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = median(all_data$valence), color = "black", alpha = 0.4) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  xlab("Playlist") + ylab("Valence")
edav_valence_box
```

```{r}
edav_energy_box <- ggplot(all_data, aes(x = reorder(playlist_name, -1*energy, FUN = median), y = energy)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill='#FF9966') + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = median(all_data$energy), color = "black", alpha = 0.4) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  xlab("Playlist") + ylab("Energy")
edav_energy_box
```

Adding averages to help with interactive component

```{r}
top_10 <- read_csv("top_10.csv", col_names =  TRUE)
averages <- class_data %>% summarise_at(vars(danceability, energy, normalized_loudness, valence, normalized_tempo, acousticness, speechiness, normalized_pop), funs(median(., na.rm = TRUE)))
averages$track_name <- "all_dsi"
averages$artist_name <- "dsi"
names(averages) <- c("danceability", "energy", "loudness", "valence", "tempo", "acousticness", "speechiness", "track_popularity", "track_name", "artist_name")
averages <- averages[c(9, 10, 1:8)]
top_10 <- rbind(top_10, averages)
write.csv(top_10, file = "top_10v2.csv")
```
